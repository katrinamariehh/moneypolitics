Creating a database with information about Campaign Funding information and bills and votes in Congress to look at relationship between where members of congress get their funding and how they vote on relevent legislation.

Overview
----------------------
Having used databases without understanding them, I wanted to explore the process of creating and filling a database with data that was not my own.  I am also interested in the ways in which technology can be used for the greater social good (see [here](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-07-20/pothole-app/56367586/1) for inspiration).  By bringing all of the relevent information together, I learned not only about what goes into building a database but also about how to make the information in the database is accessible and meaningful.
